## Changelog


### **v0.3.1**: Modal for creating conferences and get conference list from live endpoint
- add conference button inside the navbar which opens a modal form for creating a conference, on submit refreshes the page (for now, should be changed in the future)
- conference list is now retrieved from the live endpoint instead of the dummy one which returned a constant value
- added neccessary libraries for bootstrap modals

### **v0.3**: Documentation for new endpoints, password reset and navbar
- sick placeholder logo
- password reset by email (kinda)
- moved logout button inside the navbar
- login page now redirects back to previous page

### **v0.2**: Expanded authentication system, dummy api endpoint and a simple vue component based frontend
- dynamic elements handled by vue components
- bootstrap dark theme
- axios request interceptor for abstracting away jwt token authentication
- password change and password reset

### **v0.1**: JWT authentication system proof of concept
- home page automatically sending a get request to a restricted endpoint of the API (simulating the loading of the conference list or whatever)
- redirect to login page when user is not authenticated
- obtain access token from the API using the user's credentials
- new account creation
- log out functionality

## TODO
- encapsulate API interaction javascript layer
- make use of JWT refresh tokens and reduce access token lifespan
